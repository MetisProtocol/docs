    <Accordion title="What are Decentralized Sequencers?">
        Decentralized Sequencers are key entities within the Metis Layer 2 ecosystem, responsible for:

        - Sequencing transactions and assembling blocks on the Metis Layer 2 chain.
        - Submitting batched transactions to Ethereum Layer 1 for security and finality.
        - Ensuring seamless rotation and fault tolerance through decentralized governance.

        Unlike centralized systems, Metis leverages a pool of decentralized sequencers to distribute responsibilities and eliminate single points of failure. This model enhances the resilience of the network while fostering community-driven participation.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why Decentralized Sequencers?">
        The transition to decentralized sequencers is a critical milestone for Metis. The primary objectives include:

        1. **Resilience and Security**: Elimination of single points of failure by distributing the sequencing process across multiple nodes.
        2. **Fair Participation**: Introducing a weighted voting mechanism based on staked METIS tokens, ensuring fairness in sequencer selection.
        3. **Governance and Accountability**: Establishing governance mechanisms to penalize malicious behavior and reward contributors.
        4. **Efficiency and Scalability**: Ensuring efficient transaction processing and block production across the Layer 2 network.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Key Features of Decentralized Sequencers">
        1. **Sequencer Rotation**
           - Ensures fair distribution of block production roles.
           - Utilizes a rotation mechanism managed by the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus layer and smart contracts.
        2. **Fault Tolerance**
           - Automatic reselection of sequencers in case of failure or malicious activity.
           - Guarantees network stability by replacing inactive or misbehaving sequencers.
        3. **Community Governance**
           - Decentralized governance ensures community participation in decision-making.
           - Slashing mechanisms to penalize malicious behavior and reward honest participants.
        4. **Transparency**

           - Publicly auditable sequencer operations and rotation records.
           - All sequencer-related actions are stored on-chain, ensuring transparency.

    <Accordion title="What are the Risks Associated with Sequencer Mining?">
        In case of bad performance or malicious acting, the particular sequencer pool participant’s locked tokens would be slashed.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="In what cases is a Particular Sequencer Considered Malicious?">
        Cases would include but not limited to:

        1. Transaction manipulation (MEV or sandwiching)
        2. Malicious Execution Result Modification: If a node modifies the execution result of a block, it will fail validation by other sequencers. This will cause other sequencers to stop producing blocks. The node will then be forced to produce a new block with the correct execution result.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How is “Bad Performance” Defined?">
        Cases would include but not limited to:

        1. Failing to produce a block during a certain period of time
        2. Slow performance: if the sequencer fails to produce the blocks vastly behind the average timing of other sequencers
        3. Multiple Node Outages: If multiple nodes go offline at the same time, and they are all malicious, they should be punished more severely. This includes nodes that represent more than 1/3 of the total number of sequencers
        4. Accumulated Unpacked Blocks: If a node does not pack a block for a certain number of transactions, other sequencers can vote to slash it.
