## Interacting with the DEX

A Decentralized Exchange (DEX) allows users to swap tokens directly from their wallets, provide liquidity, and earn fees. To use the DEX:

1. **Connect Your Wallet**: Use a wallet like MetaMask or Rabby to connect to the [DEX Interface](https://hype-test-dex.metis.io).

2. **Swap Tokens**:
   - Select the token you want to swap from and the token you want to receive.
   - Enter the amount and review the estimated output.
   - Approve the token if required, then confirm the swap.
3. **Provide Liquidity**:
   - Go to the "Liquidity" section.
   - Select the token pair and amounts to deposit.
   - Approve both tokens if necessary, then supply liquidity.
   - You will receive LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens representing your share.

## Querying DEX Data with the Subgraph

The subgraph indexes on-chain DEX events and exposes them via a GraphQL API for easy querying.

1. **Access the Subgraph**:

   - Use the [Subgraph Endpoint](https://subgraph.metis.io/subgraphs/name/hype-test-dex)

2. **Example Queries**:
   - **Fetch Recent Swaps**:
     ```graphql
     query {
       swaps(first: 5, orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc) {
         id
         sender
         amount0In
         amount0Out
         amount1In
         amount1Out
         timestamp
       }
     }
     ```
   - **Get Liquidity Pool Stats**:
     ```graphql
     query {
       pairs {
         id
         token0 {
           symbol
         }
         token1 {
           symbol
         }
         reserve0
         reserve1
         totalSupply
       }
     }
     ```
