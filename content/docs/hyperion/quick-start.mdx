Welcome to the Metis SDK! This guide will help you quickly launch a Metis Hyperion node.



## What is the Metis SDK?

Metis SDK provides a **parallel execution engine** for the [Reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth) Ethereum node. Instead of processing transactions one by one, it uses multiple CPU cores to execute them concurrently, dramatically speeding up block processing. It manages shared data using a *multi-version memory system* and coordinates tasks with a *scheduler*.

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain installed (`rustc`, `cargo`).
- Familiarity with building and running Rust projects.

## 1. Add Metis SDK to Your Project

Clone or add the Metis SDK source to your workspace. See the [Metis SDK repository](https://github.com/MetisProtocol/metis-sdk) for details.

## 2. Start Your Node

Start your node with the Metis SDK parallel executor:

```bash
cargo run --bin metis node --dev
```
