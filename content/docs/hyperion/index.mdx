## Key Features

- **High-Performance & Decentralized Execution**: Parallel execution, real-time transaction ordering, and optimized sequencing
- **Decentralized Sequencer Network**: Eliminates single points of failure, ensures fair ordering, and reduces MEV exploitation
- **Native Infrastructure**: Paymaster support and cross-chain interoperability

## Technical Architecture Overview

Metis Hyperion is built on a layered architecture that combines the strength of Ethereum security with high-performance execution:

1. **Cross-Chain Scalability Layer**: Ensures interoperability across blockchain networks
2. **Networking & Consensus Layer**: Manages data synchronization and consensus
3. **High-Performance Execution Layer**: Powers the real-time transaction processing
4. **Data Services Layer**: Provides efficient storage and state management

## Relationship with Andromeda

While Andromeda remains Metis' established Layer 2 network designed for general-purpose DApps, Metis Hyperion (HYPE) represents the next evolution focused on high-performance execution, decentralized sequencing, and gas fee flexibility. Both networks will coexist within the Metis ecosystem, serving different use cases.

## Key Technical Breakthroughs

Metis Hyperion introduces several groundbreaking technologies:

- **Real-Time Transaction Processing**: Sub-second transaction finality
- **MetisVM**: High-performance virtual machine with dynamic opcode optimization
- **Parallel Execution Framework**: Concurrent transaction processing
- **MetisDB**: Optimized state management system
- **Decentralized Sequencer Network**: Fair and censorship-resistant transaction ordering

In the following sections, we'll explore each component in depth to help developers understand and build on the Metis Hyperion network.
