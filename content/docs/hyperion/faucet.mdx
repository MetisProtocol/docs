# Testnet Faucet

To start developing on Hyperion, you'll need some test tokens. This guide will walk you through the process of obtaining test tokens from the Hyperion faucet.

## Steps to Get Testnet Tokens

1. Visit the Hyperion Faucet at [https://t.me/hyperion_testnet_bot](https://t.me/hyperion_testnet_bot)

2. This will take you to our Telegram bot. Send the following command:
   ```
   /start 0xyour_address
   ```
   Replace `0xyour_address` with your actual wallet address.

3. The bot will send you 0.01 tMETIS tokens to your wallet.

## Important Notes

- You can request tokens once every 24 hours
- Make sure you're using the correct network (Hyperion Testnet) in your wallet
- Tokens are usually delivered within 30 seconds
