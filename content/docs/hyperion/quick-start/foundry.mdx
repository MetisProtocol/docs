# Deploying a Counter Contract with Foundry

This guide will walk you through deploying a counter contract using Foundry, a fast and portable toolkit for Ethereum application development.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A code editor (e.g., VS Code)
- Git installed
- (Optional) MetaMask wallet for deploying to testnets
- (Optional) RPC endpoint for deploying to a network

## 2. Install Foundry

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

This installs foundryup, the Foundry installer.

Next, run:

```bash
foundryup
```

This will install the Foundry toolchain (forge, cast, anvil, chisel).

Check the installation:

```bash
forge --version
```

## 3. Initialize a New Project

Create a new directory for your project and initialize Foundry:

```bash
forge init my_foundry_project
cd my_foundry_project
```

This creates a project with the following structure:

- `src/` - for your smart contracts
- `test/` - for Solidity tests
- `script/` - for deployment scripts
- `lib/` - for dependencies
- `foundry.toml` - project configuration file

## 4. Explore the Sample Contract

Foundry initializes your project with a sample contract in `src/Counter.sol`:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract Counter {
    uint256 public number;

    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
        number = newNumber;
    }

    function increment() public {
        number++;
    }
}
```

This contract stores a number and allows you to set or increment it.

## 5. Compile the Contract

Compile your smart contracts with:

```bash
forge build
```

This command compiles all contracts in `src/` and outputs artifacts to the `out/` directory.

## 6. Run Tests

Foundry supports writing tests in Solidity (in the `test/` directory). To run all tests:

```bash
forge test
```

You'll see output indicating which tests passed or failed. The default project includes a sample test for the Counter contract.

## 7. Deploying Your Contract (Optional)

To deploy your contract to a testnet or mainnet, you'll need:

- An RPC URL (from a provider like Infura, Alchemy, or QuickNode)
- A private key with testnet ETH

For Hyperion testnet, use these details:
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Chain ID | 133717 |
| Currency Symbol | tMETIS |
| RPC URL | https://hyperion-testnet.metisdevops.link |
| Block Explorer | https://hyperion-testnet-explorer.metisdevops.link |
| Faucet | [Telegram Bot](https://t.me/hyperion_testnet_bot), [Website](https://hype-faucet.metis.io) |

Example deployment command for Hyperion testnet:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url https://hyperion-testnet.metisdevops.link \
  --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> \
  src/Counter.sol:Counter \
  --broadcast
```

Replace `<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>` with your actual private key. Never share your private key.

## 8. Interacting with Contracts

You can use cast to interact with deployed contracts, send transactions, or query data. For example, to read the number variable on Hyperion testnet:

```bash
cast call <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "number()(uint256)" --rpc-url https://hyperion-testnet.metisdevops.link
```

## Next Steps

- Add more complex functionality to your counter contract
- Implement events for better tracking
- Add access control mechanisms
- Set up continuous integration
- Add more comprehensive tests

Remember to always test your contracts thoroughly before deploying to mainnet!
