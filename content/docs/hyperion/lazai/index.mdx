Alith builds a decentralized ecosystem for AI services. It allows users to run and monetize AI tasks like _inference_, _data querying_, and _fine-tuning models_. The core idea is that **Agents** act as intelligent orchestrators, using various tools and data stores to complete tasks. All services provided by the network's **AI Nodes** are managed and paid for through a secure **blockchain-based settlement system**.
