Monitoring is critical for maintaining the reliability, security, and performance of your dApp. Effective monitoring allows you to detect issues early, respond to incidents quickly, and ensure a seamless experience for your users. It also helps with compliance and auditing, which are increasingly important in the blockchain space.

## Types of Monitoring

- **Transaction Monitoring:** Track on-chain transactions, failed/successful calls, and gas usage.
- **Smart Contract Monitoring:** Watch for specific contract events, anomalies, or upgrades.
- **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Ensure your RPC nodes, APIs, and backend services are healthy and performant.
- **User Activity Monitoring:** Analyze user flows, wallet connections, and interaction patterns.
