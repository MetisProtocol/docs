Flair provides **indexing primitives** (such as fault-tolerant RPC ingestors, custom processors, re-org aware database integrations) to make it easy to receive, transform, store and access your on-chain data.

## Why Flair?

Compared to other alternatives the main reasons are:

- Adopting parallel and distributed processing paradigm means high scalability and resiliency for your indexing stack. Instead of constrained sequential processing (e.g Subgraph).
- Focused on primitives, which means on the left you plug-in an RPC and on the right you output the data to any destination database.
- Native real-time stream processing for certain data workload (such as aggregations, rollups) for things like total volume per pool, or total portfolio per user wallet.
- Managed cloud services avoid DevOps and irrelevant engineering costs for dApp developers.
- Avoid decentralization overhead (consensus, network hops, etc) since we believe to enable best UX for dApps reading data must be as close to the developers as possible.

## Key Features

- Listen to any EVM chain with just an RPC URL.
  - Free managed RPC URLs for +8 popular chains already included.
  - Works with both websocket and https-only RPCs.
- Track and ingest any contract for any event topic.
  - Auto-track new contracts deployed from factory contracts.
- Custom processor scripts with Javascript runtime (with Typescript support)
  - Make external API or Webhook calls to third-party or your backend.
  - Get current or historical USD value of any ERC20 token amount of any contract address on any chain.
  - Use any external NPM library.
- Stream any stored data to your destination database (Postgres, MongoDB, MySQL, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Timescale, etc).
