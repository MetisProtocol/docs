## What Are RPCs?

**Remote Procedure Call (RPC) endpoints** are the backbone of blockchain connectivity. They allow wallets, dApps, indexers, and backend services to communicate with the Metis networkâ€”sending transactions, reading on-chain data, and subscribing to events. Every interaction with the blockchain (outside of running your own node) relies on RPC endpoints.

## Types of RPC Endpoints

- **Public RPCs:** Free and easy to use, but subject to rate limits and congestion. Best for development, testing, and light usage.
- **Private RPC Providers:** Offer higher throughput, reliability, and support. Ideal for production dApps, bots, and high-traffic services.
- **Self-Hosted Nodes:** Maximum control, privacy, and reliability. Recommended for enterprise, indexers, or when handling sensitive data.

## Common Use Cases

- **Frontend dApps:** Connect wallets and user interfaces to the Metis blockchain.
- **Backend Services:** Power bots, relayers, analytics, and automation.
- **Indexers & Analytics:** Aggregate and process on-chain data at scale.
- **Monitoring:** Track contract events, network health, and infrastructure status.

## Key Considerations

- **Rate Limits:** Public endpoints may throttle requests. Use private or self-hosted solutions for higher limits.
- **Latency:** Choose geographically close endpoints to reduce response times.
- **Reliability:** Monitor for downtime and have fallback endpoints.
- **Security:** Never expose private keys to RPC endpoints you don't control. Use HTTPS and restrict access as needed.
- **Compatibility:** Ensure the endpoint supports all required methods (e.g., websockets for subscriptions).

All public RPCs are rate limited. If you need higher rate limits, consider the following options:

## Best Practices for Using RPCs

- **Use Multiple Endpoints:** Implement fallback logic to switch endpoints if one fails.
- **Monitor Health:** Regularly check latency and uptime of your RPC providers.
- **Cache Responses:** For frequently-read data, cache results to reduce load and latency.
- **Secure Sensitive Operations:** Only sign transactions on endpoints you trust or control.
- **Stay Updated:** Watch for network upgrades or endpoint deprecations from your provider.

## How to Get Started

1. **Choose an Endpoint:** Use public endpoints for development, private or self-hosted for production.
2. **Integrate in Your dApp:** Configure your web3 provider (ethers.js, web3.js, etc.) with the RPC URL.
3. **Test Thoroughly:** Simulate high load and failover scenarios in staging.
4. **Monitor and Iterate:** Continuously monitor performance and update endpoints as needed.

## Example: Switching RPC Endpoints in ethers.js

```js
import { ethers } from "ethers";

const endpoints = [
  "https://andromeda.metis.io/?owner=1088",
  "https://metis-mainnet.public.blastapi.io",
  // Add more as needed
];

let provider;
for (const url of endpoints) {
  try {
    provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(url);
    await provider.getBlockNumber(); // Test connectivity
    break;
  } catch (e) {
    // Try next endpoint
  }
}

if (!provider) throw new Error("No healthy RPC endpoints available");
```
