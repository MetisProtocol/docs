Data and analytics are essential for tracking your project's growth, understanding user behavior, and making data-driven decisions. For dApps on Andromeda/Metis, leveraging analytics can help you:

- Monitor on-chain activity (transactions, TVL, user growth)
- Track protocol health and adoption
- Identify trends and optimize features
- Demonstrate traction to the community and investors

## Types of Analytics

- **On-chain Analytics:** Track blockchain metrics such as transaction volume, active addresses, TVL, and contract interactions.
- **Custom/Event Analytics:** Instrument your dApp to log custom events (e.g., swaps, mints, votes) for deeper insights.

## Best Practices for dApp Analytics

- **Define Key Metrics:** Decide what matters (e.g., DAUs, TVL, retention, conversion rates).
- **Automate Data Collection:** Use APIs or event logging to gather data in real time.
- **Visualize Results:** Build dashboards or use provider tools to share insights with your team/community.
- **Respect Privacy:** Be transparent about data collection and comply with relevant regulations.

## How to Get Started

1. **Pick a Provider:** Start with DefiLlama or Routescan for high-level metrics.
2. **Integrate Analytics:** For custom tracking, consider event logging in your dApp frontend/backend.
3. **Explore APIs:** Most providers offer APIs for programmatic access to data.
4. **Build Dashboards:** Use Grafana to build dashboards for your dApp.
