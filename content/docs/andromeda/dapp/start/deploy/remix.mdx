### Prepare Your Smart Contract

1. Go to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Create a new file (e.g., `MyContract.sol`)
3. Paste the smart contract code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

contract MyToken {
    string public name = "My Token";
    string public symbol = "MTK";
    uint8 public decimals = 18;
    uint256 public totalSupply = 1000000 * 10**18;

    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowance;

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);

    constructor() {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] = totalSupply;
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) public returns (bool) {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= value, "Insufficient balance");
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= value;
        balanceOf[to] += value;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, value);
        return true;
    }

    function approve(address spender, uint256 value) public returns (bool) {
        allowance[msg.sender][spender] = value;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, value);
        return true;
    }

    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) public returns (bool) {
        require(balanceOf[from] >= value, "Insufficient balance");
        require(allowance[from][msg.sender] >= value, "Not approved");
        balanceOf[from] -= value;
        balanceOf[to] += value;
        allowance[from][msg.sender] -= value;
        emit Transfer(from, to, value);
        return true;
    }
}
```

4. Compile your contract by clicking on the "Solidity Compiler" tab and pressing "Compile"

### Deploy Using Rabby Wallet

1. In Remix, go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab
2. Change the environment to "Injected Provider - Rabby" or "Injected Provider - MetaMask" - if you don't see this connection, click "Customize this list..." and add the related plugin
3. When prompted, connect your Wallet to Remix
4. Ensure you're on the correct network in your wallet
5. Select your contract from the dropdown
6. Click "Deploy"
7. The Wallet will open a confirmation popup:
   - Review contract deployment details
   - Check the gas fee
   - Confirm the transaction

</Step>
<Step>

## Verify Your Contract (Optional)

1. After deployment, copy your contract address from Remix
2. Go to the [Block Explorer](https://sepolia-explorer.metisdevops.link/)
3. Paste and search the contract address
4. Navigate to the "Verify Contract" section
5. Enter your contract address
6. Upload your source code or paste it directly
7. Complete verification

</Step>
<Step>

## Step 4: Interact with Your Contract

1. In Remix, under the "Deployed Contracts" section, you'll see your contract
2. Expand it to view all available functions
3. Use the interface to call functions and interact with your contract
4. For transactions that modify state, your wallet will prompt for confirmation

</Step>
</Steps>

## Conclusion

You've successfully deployed a smart contract using a Wallet on the Metis Sepolia chain. This same process works for any EVM-compatible blockchain.

Remember to always test your contracts on testnets before deploying to mainnet, and ensure you understand the security implications of your smart contract code.
