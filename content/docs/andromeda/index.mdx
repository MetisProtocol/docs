Metis is a next-generation **Layer 2 Ethereum solution**, designed to empower decentralized applications and businesses with **scalability, low-cost transactions**, and a user-centric ecosystem. By leveraging advanced technologies like **Optimistic Rollups** and **Decentralized Sequencers**, Metis aims to overcome the limitations of traditional blockchain networks while maintaining the core ethos of decentralization and security.

## Key Features of Metis

- **Scalability**: Supports high transaction throughput while maintaining low latency and cost.
- **Ethereum Compatibility**: Fully compatible with Ethereum's EVM, making it easy for developers to deploy dApps.
- **Decentralized Sequencing**: Eliminates single points of failure by decentralizing the process of transaction ordering and block production.
- **Community-Driven Governance**: Encourages collaboration and community-led decision-making.
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Facilitates seamless asset and data transfer between Ethereum Layer 1 and Metis Layer 2.

## Structure

The entire structure of Metis Layer 2 is designed around several algorithm loops which are designated to mitigate the potential damage and filter the possible malfunctions of decentralized actors and/or other outer ill-wishers.

There are 7 distinguished actors participating in the system (Governance Protocol is a part of L1 / Smart contract, but it handles a number of functions that make it a separate entity):

1. **User** sends the transactions;
2. **Sequencer Node** is responsible for correcting the blockchain, propagating the blocks through the Peer Network;
3. **Metis Blockchain** is an entity held by Decentralized Sequencer;
4. **Verifier** is the counterpart of Sequencer, mostly responsible for keeping an eye on the Sequencer to not provide false/invalid data;
5. **L1 Smart Contracts** â€” the set of smart contracts that handle the security of the system, solve the disputes between Sequencer and Verifier;
6. **Memolabs** stores the transaction data;
7. **The Governance Protocol** is responsible for anything related to the efficiency of the system.
