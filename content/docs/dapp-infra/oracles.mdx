**Oracles** bridge the gap between blockchain systems and the external world, enabling smart contracts to interact with off-chain data sources. By connecting blockchains to external systems, oracles provide the crucial capability for smart contracts to execute based on real-world inputs, such as market prices, weather data, or random number generation.

Metis is integrated with leading Oracle providers to ensure developers have reliable and secure access to external data. Below is an overview of the Oracle providers supported within the Metis ecosystem:
