The **Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)** is a powerful tool that allows developers to build cross-chain decentralized applications (dApps) that communicate seamlessly between different blockchain networks. With CCIP on Metis, you can enable smart contracts on one chain (e.g., Ethereum) to trigger actions on Metis and vice versa. This opens up new possibilities for cross-chain applications, asset transfers, and messaging between Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions.

The CCIP provides a secure, scalable way to handle complex cross-chain interactions, ensuring consistency and security in a multi-chain environment. To help you get started with CCIP on Metis, we’ve provided the following examples and open-source code contributions from the community. These examples show real-world use cases of how CCIP can be implemented.

  >This example demonstrates how you can use CCIP to build a cross-chain Tic-Tac-Toe game that operates across different blockchain networks. Players on different chains can participate in the game, with contract calls interacting across chains seamlessly.</Card>

  This repository showcases how to set up a basic token transfer system using
  CCIP to move assets between chains. It’s a simple, foundational use case that
  can be extended to more complex asset management solutions or cross-chain DeFi
  applications.
