[Envio](https://envio.dev/) is a feature-rich indexing solution that provides developers with a seamless and efficient way to index and aggregate real-time or historical blockchain data for any EVM. The indexed data is easily accessible through custom GraphQL queries, providing developers with the flexibility and power to retrieve specific information.

Envio offers native support for Metis (both testnet and mainnet) and has been designed to support high-throughput blockchain applications that rely on real-time data for their business requirements.

Designed to optimize the user experience, Envio offers automatic code generation, flexible language support, quickstart templates, and a reliable cost-effective [hosted service](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/hosted-service).

Indexers on Envio can be written in JavaScript, TypeScript, or ReScript.

## Why Envio?

Envio supports [HyperSync](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/hypersync) on Metis mainnet.

HyperSync is an accelerated data query layer for the Metis blockchain, providing APIs that bypass JSON-RPC for 20-100x faster syncing of historical data. HyperSync is used by default in Envio's indexing framework, with the use of RPC being optional. Using HyperSync, application developers do not need to worry about RPC URLs, rate-limiting, or managing infrastructure and can easily sync large datasets in a few minutes, something that would usually take hours or days using RPC.

HyperSync is also available as a standalone API for data analytic use cases. Data analysts can interact with the HyperSync API using JavaScript, Python, or Rust clients and extract data in JSON, Arrow, or Parquet formats. For more information, visit the HyperSync documentation [here](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/overview-hypersync).

## Key Features

- Contract Import: Autogenerate the key boilerplate for an entire Indexer project off a single or multiple smart contracts. Deploy within minutes.
- Multi-chain Support: Aggregate data across multiple networks into a single database. Query all your data with a unified GraphQL API.
- Asynchronous Mode: Fetch data from off-chain storage such as IPFS, or contract state (e.g. smart contract view functions).
- Quickstart Templates: Use pre-defined indexing logic for popular OpenZeppelin contracts (e.g. ERC-20).
